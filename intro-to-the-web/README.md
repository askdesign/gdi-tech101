## Course Description

The web is a vital part of our everyday lives, but how does it really work? This beginner-friendly class explores the origins of the web, explains a few of its quirks, and breaks down what happens between entering a URL into our browsers and seeing the web come alive on our screens.

## Course Objectives

You'll get a better understanding of a fundamental part of todayâ€™s tech industry and learn about the diverse opportunities available to those considering career paths in this evolving field.

## Course Outline

* History: How did the web come to be this way?
* Web pages: What does a web browser do?
* Mechanics: How does the web work?
* Careers: Who makes websites?

## Updating this course

This was a first draft of this course by KC Soderstrom, with reference to GDI's [Featured Web Concepts](https://github.com/girldevelopit/gdi-featured-web-concepts) and GDI SF's [Tech 101: What is the Web?](https://github.com/gdisf/teaching-materials/tree/master/tech101).

Some questions that came up that could easily be covered:

* What is the difference between Java and JavaScript? A discussion of how it got to be named JavaScript would naturally fit in on the JavaScript discussion slide.
* Web hosting services, including the meaning of different DNS record types. A live example could be instructive but it might be too much.
* How do IP addresses work? There is a great slide for this already in Featured Web Concepts IINM which could be ported over; one student also wondered how IP addresses get assigned, very on-topic.
* The role of JavaScript in a website. A live coding demonstration could be helpful here. An exercise could be great too, but might be best for a more focused class with time and structure for debugging.
* What's the difference between HTTP and HTTPS?
* What is a LAN? What is a WAN? Could talk about how these relate to the Internet and WWW.

I also minimized discussion of DNS servers out of concern that it would be too complicated, but that may have been overcautious; more discussion of DNS servers and including them in the "Mechanics" section might be worthwhile.

I'm personally foggy about the transition from ARPANET and other state-centered networks to the World Wide Web; clarifying that transition at the end of the last ARPANET slide would be great.

Overall I tried to allude to each layer of the OSI model without explicitly laying it out in a dry inaccessible way. It's messy and could be done better. The students probably deserve a link to info on the OSI model somewhere in case they want to look into it themselves.
